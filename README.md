# Eve Mate
Hello capsuleer,
[Eve Mate](http://evemate.space) is a web application that will display any information stored in the API servers of [Eve Online](https://www.eveonline.com/).
This project is still in an early stage of developement, but anyone is free to have a look at it and help in its development!
You can find the last stable version hosted at [evemate.breincorporation.com](https://evemate.breincorporation.com/).
Eve Mate is developed with Angular 4 using the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
